    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">The Andromeda Galaxy is the closest big spiral galaxy to the Milky Way. In this image, orange shows Herschel observations of dust in cool star-forming clouds. Blue shows X-rays given off by dying stars, as seen by the XMM-Newton satellite. The bright outer ring of dust is thought to have been caused by a collision between Andromeda and another galaxy.
