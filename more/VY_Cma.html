    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">VY Canis Majoris is the largest measured star in the Milky Way. It has 40 times the mass of our Sun, and is over 2,000 times the size. If the Sun were the size of a football, VY Canis Majoris would be bigger than Wembley Stadium! It's shedding a huge cloud of gas amd dust as it dies. Herschel can see the light "fingerprint" of the chemicals in this cloud, to let us know what's there.
