    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">Herschel's HIFI instrument has measured the far-infrared spectrum of the Orion Nebula. Different atoms & molecules emit light in spikes at different parts of the spectrum, so we can identify them using this "fingerprint" of light. The Orion Nebula contains many complex molecules that are precursors to life, and would've been found on the early earth.
