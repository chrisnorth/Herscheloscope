    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">The Large Magellanic Cloud is a small galaxy that orbits our own. It's only 14,000 light-years across, whilst the Milky Way's diameter is over 100,000 light years. So it's too small to have formed a spiral structure, and instead has an irregular, lumpy shape. In this false-colour, red shows cold clouds of interstellar dust, which are speckled with bright blue stellar nurseries.</p>
