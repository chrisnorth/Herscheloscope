    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">NGC 1999 is a nebula which is reflecting the light of the star V380 Orionis. It used to be thought that the dark patch to its right, seen by optical telescopes like Hubble, was caused by dust blocking the reflected light. Such dust would glow in the far-infrared, where Herschel sees. But Herschel saw a dark patch there, too. It's simply a hole in the nebula. Now we think that the wind from young stars might be blowing a cavity in the cloud.</p>
