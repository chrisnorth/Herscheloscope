    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">The Polaris Flare is a network of filaments of gas and dust near the pole star, Polaris. These structures are made by the shockwaves from exploded stars passing through space. It was thought that these filaments would all be different shapes & sizes, but Herschel has shown that they in fact all have very similar widths, providing clues about how such filaments go on to form stars.
