    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">Uranus was discovered by 1781 by Sir William Herschel, one of the family after whom the Herschel Space Telescope is named. Uranus is very cold, so it's extremely bright in the far-infrared part of the spectrum; but it's too small to see as anything other than a point of light. The spikes and rings in this image are due to the telescopeâ€™s internal structure causing artifacts in the image. The telescope uses Uranus to calibrate its instruments.</p>
