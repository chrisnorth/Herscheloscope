    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">Herschel has found molecule of oxygen deep in the heart of the Orion Nebula. This the first time pairs of oxygen atoms have been seen together in molecules in space. Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe, and oxygen molecules make up most of the mass of Earth's mass. It is thought most of the oxygen molecules in space are locked up in ice crystals, and only get released in warmer regions, such as the core of the Orion Nebula.</p>
