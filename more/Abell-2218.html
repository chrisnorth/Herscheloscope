    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">The huge mass of the galaxy cluster Abell 2218 makes it act as a "gravitational lens", magnifying the even more distant galaxies behind it. The blue-ish objects in the image are galaxies in Abell 2218, but the red blob is a galaxy so far away that we're seeing it as it was when the cosmos was only 1/17th as old as it is today.</p>
