    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">The very first thing seen by Herschel is one of the most beautiful objects in the sky, the Whirlpool Galaxy. Its spiral arms are clearly visible in red and yellow, with bright blue blobs marking regions of star formation. The bright blue region at the top of the image is a smaller galaxy, which is in the process of merging with the Whirlpool Galaxy.</p>
