    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">The Cocoon Nebula is well named. It's a long, thin filament of gas and dust, with a newborn star at the tip, tearing it open. Filaments like this are key to star formation. They are thought to be formed when shockwaves from exploding stars pass through clouds of interstellar gas and dust, sculpting them into intricate patterns.</p>
