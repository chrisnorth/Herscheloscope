    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">The Rossette Nebula is a cloud of gas and dust containing enough material to make 10,000 stars like our Sun. This false-colour image shows the temperature of different parts of the nebula. The red blobs at the bottom are protostars. The blue region at the top is being heated by a cluster of hot, young stars. They will live short lives (less than 1/10th as long as our Sun's). By the time these die, the protostars will have evolved into fully-fledged stars in their own right.</p>
