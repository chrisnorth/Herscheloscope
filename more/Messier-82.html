    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">Messier 82 is a "starburst" galaxy, which means it's experiencing an incredible surge in star formation, well over 10 times the rate in the Milky Way. This was triggered by the gravity from a neighbouring galaxy. This image shows M82's far-infrared spectrum. The spikes are the "fingerprints" of atoms & molecules found there. This tells us how much of different materials are in M82, and what conditions they're in.</p>
