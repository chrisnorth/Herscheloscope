    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">Herschel is the first telescope to be able to piece a dense shroud of dust in the constellation of Aquila and reveal this previously unseen stellar nursery, where 700 stars are being born. This cloud is part of the Gould Belt, a mysterious ring of stars, gas and dust thatâ€™s tilted by about 20-30<sup>o</sup> compared to the rest of the Milky Way. It may have been formed 30 million years ago when a blob of invisible dark matter collided with our part of the galaxy.</p>
