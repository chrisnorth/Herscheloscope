    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">CW Leonis is a star that is reaching the end of its life. It has swollen up to massive proportions (700 times larger than our sun), and is blowing away massive amounts of its material in a violent stellar wind. This wind is slamming into the gas that lies between stars, causing a "bow shock", seen at the top of the top of the image. Herschel has seen a cloud of water vapour forming close to the star, at nearly 1,000<sup>o</sup>C.</p>
