    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p>This image combines data from PACS and SPIRE to form a three-colour image.  Cooler material is shown in red, while warmer material is blue - but all just 10-50 degrees above absolute zero.  This image is taken in constellation of Vulpecula and shows the entire assembly line of newborn stars. The diffuse glow reveals the widespread cold reservoir of raw material which our Galaxy has in stock for the production of new stars.</p>

<p>As this cool material flows around, it collides with itself and forms filaments of dust threading through the Galaxy.  These filaments house denser clumps, with the gas and dust radiating away its heat.  When the clumps get large enough and dense enough, their own gravity causes a stellar embryo to form, eventually becoming a star in its own right.</p>
