    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">Despite being in the direction of the Milky Way the Southern Cross is quite a dark patch of sky when viewed in visible light. That's because it's filled with clouds of dust which obscure starlight. But to Herschel's far-infrared eyes, this dust isn't only transparent, it glows. This false-colour image tells us the temperature of the dust. Blue is warmer, red is cooler (but all only 10-50<sup>o</sup>C above absolute zero). The bright blobs are being heated by the birth of new stars.</p>
