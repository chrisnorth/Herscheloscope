    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">When astronomers want to study other galaxies, they have to look in directions where parts of our galaxy aren't in the way. The "Great Observatory Origins Deep Survey" does exactly that, and is a region of the sky that has been observed by many telescopes, including Herschel. This Herschel image is of a tiny part of the night sky, but each spec is entire galaxy, seen when the universe was only 75-25% its current age.</p>
