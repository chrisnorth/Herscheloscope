    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">This is a simulation of the early Universe, made using powerful super-computers. It shows how "halos" of dark matter surround galaxies. Dark matter makes up 80% of the mass in the universe. It's invisible, but we can observe it by looking at the way it tugs on galaxies with its gravity. This simulation was compared to Herschel observations of distant galaxies, so far away that we see them when the universe was less than a quarter its current age.</p>
