    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">To study other galaxies, we have to look in directions where the dust in the Milky Way doesn't block our view, such as the Lockman Hole. Every single dot in this Herschel image is en entire galaxy, seen as they were 10 billion years ago. They're all but invisible in optical light, but to Herschel's far-infrared eyes they glow. The way in which they are clustered tells us how they have interacted over the history of the Universe.
