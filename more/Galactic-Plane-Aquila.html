    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">You can see the Milky Way in the night sky as a whitish band flecked with dark streaks. Those dark streaks are caused by dust, at only 10-50 degrees above absolute zero, which glows in the far-infrared where Herschel sees. This picture shows part of the Milky Way's dust lanes in the constellation of Aquilla. Stars are being made in the warmer, bright blue regions. The blue "bubble" at the bottom is dust being blown away by the winds of newborn stars.</p>
