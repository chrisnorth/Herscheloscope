    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">The Milky Way is filled with clouds of cold gas & dust, like this one in the constellation of Vulpecula. As this material flows through the galaxy, it collides with itself, forming denser filaments. In these filaments parts of the clouds can collapse inwards to form new stars and planets. When a new star is born, its wind sends shockwaves through the clouds, which can go on to trigger new waves of star formation.</p>
