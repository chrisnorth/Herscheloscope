    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">In late 2010, comet Hartley 2 was visited by NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft. At the same time, it was observed by Herschel, which found that Hartley 2 loses a quarter of a tonne of water every second as it passes close to the sun. That water was very similar to the water in Earth's oceans, supporting the idea that comets provided much of the Earth's water.
