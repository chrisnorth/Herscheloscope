    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">Saturn’s moon Enceladus is spraying huge plumes of water ice out of geyser-like cracks at its south pole. This suggests Enceladus has an ocean of liquid water beneath its surface, heated by the kneading effect of Saturn’s gravity. The ejected ice forms one of Saturn’s famous rings. Herschel has absorbed water from Enceladus in Saturn’s own atmosphere.
