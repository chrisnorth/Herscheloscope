    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">RCW 120 is a bubble in space, being carved by the winds from a star at its centre. In this false-colour Herschel image, the bright blue patch at the bottom edge of the bubble is a new star being born. It's already 10 times the mass of our Sun, and it's gravity sucking up all the gas and dust around it, so it'll keep getting bigger. Such massive stars are very rare, and very short-lived, and Herschel gives us an excellent way to study how they are born.</p>
