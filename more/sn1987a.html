    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">In 1987, the closest supernova to be seen for over 400 years happened in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy that orbits the Milky Way. Supernovae happen when very massive stars at the ends of their lives explode, and are one of the sources of cosmic dust. This Herschel observation of SN1987A revealed enough dust in the remnant of the explosion to form over 200,000 Earths.
