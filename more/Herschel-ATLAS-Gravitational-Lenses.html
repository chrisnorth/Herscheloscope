    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p>A team using Herschel have discovered a new way of locating a natural phenomenon that acts like a zoom lens, allowing astronomers to peer at galaxies in the distant and early Universe. The magnification created by this phenomenon allows astronomers to see galaxies otherwise hidden from us, providing key insights into how galaxies have changed over the history of the cosmos. You can see how gravitational lensing works at the interactive part of our stand.</p>
    <p>These results are from the very first data taken as part of the "Herschel-ATLAS" project, the largest imaging survey conducted so far with Herschel. To find the true distances to the Herschel sources, the team looked for a tell-tale signature of molecular gas. Using radio and sub-millimetre telescopes on the ground, they showed that this signature implies the galaxies are being seen as they were when the Universe was just 2-4 billion years old - less than a third of its current age. The foreground galaxies seen by the optical telescopes are much closer, each ideally positioned to create a gravitational lens.</p>
