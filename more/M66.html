    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p id="txt">Messier 66 is a barred-spiral galaxy. It has two spiral arms that are linked together by a "bar" passing through the centre of the galaxy. Our own galaxy is also a barred-spiral. Herschel can see the dust in M66's arms & bar glowing in far-infrared light. The arms are being pulled out of shape by the gravity of other nearby galaxies. Every one of the smaller blobs in the background is an even more distant galaxy.</p>
